Continuous integration, or shortened to CI, is a valuable and well-established practice in modern, high performance
software engineering organizations. 

Using CI enables software development tasks to be developed independently and in
parallel amongst the assigned developers. Once one of these tasks is complete, a developer will introduce that new work
to the CI system to be integrated with the rest of the project.

## How to use

The foundational dependency of CI is a version control system (VCS). Once version control is in place, finding a version
control hosting platform is the next move. Most modern version control hosting tools have support and features built in
for CI. Some popular version control hosting platforms are Bitbucket, Github, and Gitlab. 

After version control has been established on the project, integration approval steps should be added.

Once you have a version control system setup with some merge approval steps in place, youâ€™ve established continuous
integration!

## How CI improves productivity

Continuous integration benefits are not limited to the engineering team but greatly benefit the overall organization. CI
enables better transparency and insight into the process of software development and delivery.

The following are some overall organizational benefits of CI.

### Enable scaling

CI enables organizations to scale in engineering team size, codebase size, and infrastructure. By
minimizing code integration bureaucracy and communication overhead, CI helps build DevOps and agile workflows. It allows
each team member to own a new code change through to release. 

### Improve the feedback loop

Faster feedback on business decisions is another powerful side effect of CI. Product teams can test ideas and iterate product designs faster with an
optimized CI platform. Changes can be rapidly pushed and measured for success. Bugs or other issues can be quickly
addressed and repaired. 

### Enhance communication

CI improves overall engineering communication and accountability, which
enables greater collaboration between development and operations in a DevOps team. By introducing pull request workflows
tied to CI, developers gain passive knowledge share. Pull requests allow developers to observe and comment on code from
other team members. Developers can now view and collaborate on feature branches with other developers as the features
progress through the CI Pipeline. 

### Adoption and installation 

The challenges of continuous integration are primarily
around team adoption and initial technical installation. If a team doesn't currently have a CI solution in place, it can
require some effort to pick one and get started. Thus, considerations need to be made around the existing engineering
infrastructure when installing a CI pipeline.
