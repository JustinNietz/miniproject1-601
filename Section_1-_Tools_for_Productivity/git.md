Git is a DVCSs (Distributed Version Control System) that saves data as a series of snapshots. Every time you commit, or
save the state of your project, Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a
reference to that snapshot. Git does not store files again if they have not been changed.

## Brief History

* In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.
* In 2005, tensions between the company that developed BitKeeper and the community that built Linux broke down.
* Afterwards, the Linux development community, including Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, created Git based on the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.
