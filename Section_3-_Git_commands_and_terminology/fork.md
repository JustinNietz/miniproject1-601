# Fork

A **Fork** is a *copy* of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting
the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use
someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

## How to use

You can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you
can:

* Fork the repository.

* Make the fix.

* Submit a pull request to the project owner.

To Get started on Github, you can find the button to Fork a project on the top-right of the repository.

## Keep your fork synced

You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice
to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line.
