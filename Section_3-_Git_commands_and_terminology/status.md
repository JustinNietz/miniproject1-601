# Status

The `git status` command gives us all the necessary information about the branch we are currently on. It shows which
changes have been staged, which have not, and which files are not being tracked by Git. Furthermore, it provides
information about whether a file was created, modified, or deleted. 

After using `git status` as seen in the picture below, we get a message which includes relevant instructions for staging or unstaging files.
